# Harvard python

A script for generating Harvard referencing.

## Get the script
''''
git clone https://github.com/wilsonand1/harvard-python.git
cd harvard-python
python h.py
''''

One the script is run you'll be asked:
''''
Name of file:
''''
This is the name of the out Markdown file.

Next question will be what you're referencing. Currently harvard-python supports referencing for books, websites and articles. More to come.

Next will be questions about what you're referencing. The questions will be:

''''
Author:
More authors:
Year:
Title:
Edition:
Publication location:
Publisher:
''''

Once you've filled in the last one you will see a print out of the reference in the terminal and it will be printed to the Markdown file.

Also, the code is pretty filthy.

# Harvard python

A script for generating Harvard referencing.

Pretty self explanatory, but I'll update this read me when I get the time. Just fire the script up and follow it through.

It can only reference books, websites and journal articles at the moment. I'll implement more soon. The first question names the output file.

Also, the code is pretty filthy.
